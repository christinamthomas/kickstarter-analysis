# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends of successful, failed and canceled campaigns.
## Overview of Project
A client is fundraising for a play and is seeking knowledge on how other campaigns fared with their fundraising and if any correlations can be noted from the data to increase probability of a successful campaign in the future. This analysis will show if a campaigns success was impacted by the either the month it was launched or the goal amount that was set for the campaign.
### Purpose
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis was performed by creating a pivot table utilizing the kickstarter data to do the following: analyze data for outcomes by launch date. In order to better analyze the data for outcomes by launch date I first filtered by year and category. I then utilized the data from each month to determine the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns that occurred. 
When analyzing the data for outcomes based on goals a new worksheet was created to filter the information. The number of successful, failed, and canceled projects was first determined and then the outcome percentage was noted based on total projects within that goal range. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The analysis of outcomes based on goals proved more difficult as countif was utilized to filter information leaving room for errors within the formula. This in turn could result in incorrect data as I noted when my graph varies from the graph noted on our assigment.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the results from the kickstarter campaign data it appears that the number of successful campaigns is higher in the months of May and June. Based on the data it is also noted that the end of the year (November, December) are the months with the least successful campaigns.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A higher success percentage correlates to a lower goal amount. As the goal amount increases, the percentage of successful campaigns decreases.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data for outcomes based on goals is limited by the dollar amount range utilized (range of 45,000 to 49,000 vs exact dollar amount).
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other useful tables and graphs based on the data set would be to determine the success of a campaign based on the pledged amount or to determine the success of a campaign based on the category itself.
